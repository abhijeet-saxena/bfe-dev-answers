# implement Selection Sort

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement Selection sort, which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it in-place, no need to return anything.

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

```js
function selectionSort(arr) {
  const len = arr.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
    let selection = i;
    for (let j = i; j < len; j++) {
      if (arr[selection] > arr[j]) selection = j;
    }
    if (selection !== i) [arr[selection], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[selection]];
  }

  return arr;
}
```
