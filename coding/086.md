Given 2 initial numbers, we can generate a sequence by adding the sum of last two numbers as a new lement. This is Fibonacci number.

You are asked to create a `fib(n)` function, which generate the n-th Fibonacci number.

What is the time & space cost of your solution?

```js
function fib(n) {
  if (n < 2) return n;

  let first = 0;
  let second = 1;
  let i = 2;

  while (i <= n) {
    let newNum = first + second;
    first = second;
    second = newNum;
    i++;
  }

  return second;
}
```
