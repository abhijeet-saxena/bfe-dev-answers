# implement Bubble Sort

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement Bubble Sort, which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it in-place, no need to return anything.

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

```js
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  const len = arr.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < len; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
      }
    }
  }

  return arr;
}
```
