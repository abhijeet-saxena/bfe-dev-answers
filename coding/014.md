# Implement a general memoization function - \`memo()\`

`Memoization` is a common technique to boost performance. If you use React, you definitely have used React.memo before.

Memoization is also commonly used in algorithm problem, when you have a recursion solution, in most cases, you can improve it by memoization, and then you might be able to get a Dynamic Programming approach.

So could you implement a general `memo()` function, which caches the result once called, so when same arguments are passed in, the result will be returned right away.

> const func = (arg1, arg2) => {<br>
> return arg1 + arg2<br>
> }<br>
> const memoed = memo(func)<br>
> memoed(1, 2) // 3, func is called<br>
> memoed(1, 2) // 3 is returned right away without calling func<br>
> memoed(1, 3)// 4, new arguments, so func is called

The arguments are arbitrary, so memo should accept an extra resolver parameter, which is used to generate the cache key, like what \_.memoize() does.

> const memoed = memo(func, () => 'samekey')<br>
> memoed(1, 2) // 3, func is called, 3 is cached with key 'samekey'<br>
> memoed(1, 2) // 3, since key is the same, 3 is returned without calling func<br>
> memoed(1, 3) // 3, since key is the same, 3 is returned without calling func

Default cache key could be just Array.from(arguments).join('\_')

It is a trade-off of space for time, so if you use this in an interview, please do analyze how much space it might cost.

```js
function memo(func, resolver) {
  const cache = {};

  return function (...args) {
    const key = resolver ? resolver.call(this, ...args) : [args.join("_")];
    if (!(key in cache)) {
      cache[key] = func.call(this, ...args);
    }
    return cache[key];
  };
}
```
