# invert a binary tree

Can you invert a binary tree and get an offer from Google?

Inverting a node means swapping its left child and right child. You need to apply this to all nodes.

As following figure illustrates.

```js
function invert(node) {
  let nodes = [node];

  while (nodes.length) {
    let popped = nodes.shift();

    if (popped) {
      [popped.left, popped.right] = [popped.right, popped.left];
      nodes.push(popped.left, popped.right);
    }
  }

  return node;
}
```
