```js
function count(str) {
  let freq = {};
  let max = 0;
  let answer = null;

  for (let i of str) {
    freq[i] = freq[i] ? freq[i] + 1 : 1;
  }

  for (let key in freq) {
    if (freq[key] > max) {
      max = freq[key];
      answer = key;
    } else if (freq[key] === max) {
      answer = Array.isArray(answer) ? [...answer, key] : [...answer, key];
    }
  }

  return answer;
}
```
