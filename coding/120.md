# create \`isPrime()\`

A Prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1, such as 2,3,5....

You are asked to implement isPrime() to check if a number is prime.

`Follow-up`

What is the time cost of your implementation ? can you improve your approach to have the fewest comparisons?

```js
function isPrime(num) {
  if (num === 1) return false;
  const max = Math.round(Math.sqrt(num));

  for (let i = 2; i <= max; i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```
