# implement Insertion Sort

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement Insertion Sort, which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it in-place, no need to return anything.

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

```js
function insertionSort(arr) {
  const len = arr.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
    let key = i;
    let j = i + 1;
    while (key >= 0 && arr[key] > arr[j]) {
      [arr[key], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[key]];
      key--;
      j--;
    }
  }

  return arr;
}
```
