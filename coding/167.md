# Intersection of unsorted arrays

Given two arrays, find the intersection(items occur in both arrays)

- arrays are not sorted, and might have duplicates.
- you can modify the arrays
- you can return the items in any order, but without duplicates.

This is a simple problem, What is the time & space complexity of your approach?

```js
function getIntersection(arr1, arr2) {
  const op = new Set();
  const map = {};
  for (let i of arr1) map[i] = true;
  for (let i of arr2) if (map[i]) op.add(i);
  return [...op];
}
```
