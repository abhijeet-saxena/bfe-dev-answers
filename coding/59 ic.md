# create a browser history

I believe you are very familiar about your browser you are currently visiting https://bigfrontend.dev with.

The common actions relating to history are:

new BrowserHistory() - when you open a new tab, it is set with an empty history
goBack() - go to last entry, notice the entries are kept so that forward() could get us back
forward() - go to next visited entry
visit() - when you enter a new address or click a link, this adds a new entry but truncate the entries which we could forward() to.
Say we start a new tab, this is the empty history.

[ ]
Then visit url A, B, C in turn.

[ A, B, C]
↑
We are currently at C, we could goBack() to B, then to A

[ A, B, C]
↑  
forward() get us to B

[ A, B, C]
↑  
Now if we visit a new url D, since we are currently at B, C is truncated.

[ A, B, D]
↑
You are asked to implement a BrowserHistory class to mimic the behavior.
