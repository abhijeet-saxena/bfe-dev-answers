# validate an IP address

## IPv4

An IPv4 Address is represented in dot-decimal notation, consisting of 4 numbers( called 'octet'), each ranging from 0 to 255, like 1.22.33.255. It has 32 bit, so there are maximum 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses.

Leading zeroes are not allowed in IPv4, like 01.01.01.01 is invalid.

## IPv6

An IPv6 Address have 128 bits (which is a lot), separated by 8 groups (called 'hexadectet', or 'hextet', not fixed yet).

Each group has 16 bits, so could be represented by a hexadecimal string at 4 digits, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

Notice that leading zeroes are allowed in IPv6.

There are other valid format of IPv6 addresses, like Zero compression, but it is beyond the scope here, you can ignore them.

`Task`

You are given some random string, please write a function if it is valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.

`Follow-up`

Can you solve it with regular expressions ?

```js
function isValidIP(str) {
  if (str.includes(".")) {
    const digitGroups = str.split(".");
    if (digitGroups.length !== 4) return false;

    for (let i of digitGroups) {
      if (i[0] === "0" && i.length !== 1) return false;
      const num = parseInt(i);
      if (num > 255 || isNaN(num)) return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  if (str.includes(":")) {
    const digitGroups = str.split(":");
    if (digitGroups.length !== 8) return false;

    for (let i of digitGroups) {
      if (/[g-z]/i.test(i)) return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```
