# array keys

```js
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([]));
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([,]));
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([1, , 2]));
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([...[1, , 2]]));
```

## Solution

```
["length"]
["length"]
["0","2","length"]
["0","1","2","length"]
```

## Explanation

> The static [Reflect.ownKeys()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/ownKeys) method returns an array of the target object's own property keys.

Arrays under the hood in JavaScript are Objects. Their keys are numbers, and their values are the elements. By default, all arrays also have a property `length` that reflects the number of elements in that array. In the case of a sparse array, holes do not add the corresponding key to the array.

Also, the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) converts these holes to `undefined`

`1.` Its an empty array so answer only contains `length`

`2.` This array [,] is also an empty sparse array hence holes are ignored

`3.` [1,,2] has values defined at index 0 and 2, hence it prints ["0","2","length"]

`4.` Using Spread Operator changes the input array to [1,undefined,2] thus all the keys give following output ["0","1","2","length"]

```js
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([])); // ["length"]
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([,])); // ["length"]
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([1, , 2])); // ["0","2","length"]
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys([...[1, , 2]])); // ["0","1","2","length"]
```
