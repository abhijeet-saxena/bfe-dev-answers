# reduce

```js
[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => {
  console.log(a, b);
});

[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => {
  console.log(a, b);

## Solution

```
1,2
undefined,3
0,1
undefined,2,
undefined,3
```

## Explanation

[`reduce()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) method executes a user-supplied callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result is a single value returned at the end.

This method has the following syntax â€” `reduce(callbackFn, initialValue)` where `initialValue` is an optional initial value used. If this parameter is skipped, it's assumed to be the first value of the array.

The way the reducer function works is that the first parameter `a` is the return value of the result of each iteration while the second parameter `b` is the current element while iterating.

Since we are not returning anything from the callback functions here, the function returns `undefined` implicitly.

In the first example, since the initial value is not supplied it defaults to the first item 1. `reduce` function first compares `1 and 2` and as undefined is returned inside next time it compares `undefined and 3`

In the second example, the initial value is 0. `reduce` function first compares `0 and 1` and as undefined is returned inside next time it compares `undefined and 2` and similarly `undefined and 3`

```js
[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => {
  console.log(a, b);
});
// 1, 2
// undefined, 3

[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => {
  console.log(a, b);
}, 0);
// 0,1
// undefined, 2
// undefined, 3
```
