## Explanation

`++` is an [Increment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment) and can be used in two ways.

> prefix returns the value after incrementing.

`b` is assigned the value 2 after `a` is incremented to 2

> postfix returns the value before incrementing.

`c` is assigned the value 2 before `a` is incremented to 3
