## Solution

```
"undefined"
"number"
"number"
```

## Explanation

```js
function func() {
  const a = (b = c = 1);
}
func();
console.log(typeof a, typeof b, typeof c);
```

## Explanation

In javascript, the assignment happens from right to left. So, `const` statement is only applicable to `a`, not `b` and `c`. All the other variables are considered Global without the var/let statement, hence `b` and `c` will be globally scoped.

To visualize, think of it like

```js
const a = (b = c = 1);
// which effectively becomes
const a = (window.b = window.c = 1);
```

that's why `a` is unavailable outside the function block, while `b` and `c` are 1;
Hence, the output `undefined, number, number`
