## Solution

```
[1,2,5]
```

## Explanation

A return statement in a [generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*), when executed, will [make the generator finish](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return#description) (i.e. the done property of the object returned by it will be set to true).

In this case, when we invoke the generator function `gen` and [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) it we see all the values yielded by it. The `try` block yields 1 and 2 and then `return` will finish the execution of generator.

However, the thing to remember is the `finally` block is also executed irrespective of whether gen has finished and 5 is yielded. The next `return` completes the execution. This behavior is consistent with normal functions i.e. if you have `try..finally` then statements in `finally` block are still executed despite returning from`try` block

```
function* gen() {
  try {
    yield 1
    yield 2
    return 3
    yield 4
  } finally {
    yield 5
    return 6
    yield 7
  }
}

console.log([...gen()]); // [1,2,5]
```
