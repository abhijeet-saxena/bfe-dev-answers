## Solution

```
[0,111,1111,2,999]
[0,111,1111,2,999]
```

## Explanation

```js
const a = [999, 1111, 111, 2, 0];
const b = a.sort();

console.log(a); // [0,111,1111,2,999]
console.log(b); // [0,111,1111,2,999]
```

[Array.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array

> Note that the array is sorted in place, and no copy is made.

This explains why both `a` and `b` get sorted. `a` is sorted in place while this sorted array is then assigned to `b`.

As to why numbers don't appear in order, remember that sort expects a compare function that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value.

When compared in strings, `"111" < "2"`, `"1111" < "999"`, etc.
