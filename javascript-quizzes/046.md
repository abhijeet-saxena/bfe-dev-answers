## Solution

```
false
```

## Explanation

```js
const foo = [0];
if (foo) {
  console.log(foo == true); // false
} else {
  console.log(foo == false);
}
```

In this example, `if(foo)` is trying to check if `[0]` is truthy or falsy.

Basically, if the value is or is `0`, `-0`, `null`, `false`, `NaN`, `undefined`, or `""` its `falsy`. All other values, including any object, an empty array ([]), or the string "false" are `truthy`

That's why it goes into the if `block`.

The way `==` works, If the operands are of different types, it'll try to convert them to the same type before comparing. For example, here one of the operands is a boolean, and the other is a number so it'll convert them to numbers and then compare.

```js
Number(true); // 1
Number([0]); // 0
// 1 != 0 hence the answer is false
```
