# try...catch...finally 2

```js
const prettify = (str) => {

      JSON.parse(str);
      return "prettified";
    }

## Solution

```
"BFE.dev"
"123"
```

## Explanation

In a `try...catch...finally` scenario, the [finally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch#the_finally_block) block is always executed irrespective of an error is thrown or not within the try block. Also, Control flow statements like `return` in the finally block overwrite any completion values of the try block or catch block.

In this example, for "BFE.dev" JSON.parse will throw error and control goes to the `catch` block and "errored" is returned. However, since finally block always executes and we return `str` from it, the final returned value is "BFE.dev" that gets logged

Similarly, for "123", the try block tries to return, but finally block's return value is returned instead.

```js
const prettify = (str) => {
  try {
    if (typeof str === "string") {
      JSON.parse(str);
      return "prettified";
    }
  } catch (e) {
    return "errored";
  } finally {
    return str;
  }
};

console.log(prettify("BFE.dev")); // "BFE.dev"
console.log(prettify("123")); // "123"
```
