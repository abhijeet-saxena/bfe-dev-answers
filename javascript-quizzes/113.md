## Solution

```
Error
```

## Explanation

The [push()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and <b>returns the new length of the array.</b>

Here, `b` will be assigned the length of array `a` after 4 is pushed which is 4. Then when we try, `b.push(5)` we are actually trying to do `4.push(5)` which throws an error `Uncaught TypeError: b.push is not a function`

```
const a = [1,2,3]
const b = a.push(4) // returns new length i.e. 4
const c = b.push(5) // this will fail as 4 is not an array
console.log(c) // Error
```
