# `this` II

```js
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b() {
    return this.a;
  },
};
console.log(obj.b());
console.log((true ? obj.b : a)());
console.log((true, obj.b)());
console.log((3, obj["b"])());
console.log(obj.b());
console.log((obj.c = obj.b)());
```

## Explanation

Things to know-

- In Normal Functions,Â the value of [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#function_context) is determined by how a function is called i.e. runtime binding.

- The [comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator) (,) evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand

- The [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.

- The [assignment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment) returns the value of the object specified by the left operand after the assignment

```js
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b() {
    return this.a;
  },
};

console.log(obj.b()); // 1
console.log((true ? obj.b : a)()); // undefined
console.log((true, obj.b)()); // undefined
console.log((3, obj["b"])()); // undefined
console.log(obj.b()); // 1
console.log((obj.c = obj.b)()); // undefined
```

`1.` When `b` is called as a method of `obj`, it's `this` is set to the object the method is called on (i.e. `obj` object). Hence , `this.a` is 1

`5.` (obj.b)() is same as obj.b(). Hence, similar to first case it'll print `1`

`2.`, `3.` and `4.` and `6.` Here, the statement evaluates to `obj.b` which is only the reference to a plain function. Executing this independently loses the reference to `obj`. Hence, `this` is `window` and `this.a` prints `undefined`
