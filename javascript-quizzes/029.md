```js
var a = 1;

function func() {
  a = 2;
  console.log(a);

## Solution

```
2
1
undefined
```

## Explanation

> [Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

Here, in this example inside function `func` the `var a` gets hoisted to top and hence `a=2` in that function. More so, since `a` is declared in that function only it is having a function scope i.e. it doesn't leak outside. That's why outside `func`, `a` is still 1

The variable `b` on the other hand is just declared inside a block so it gets hoisted to the top of the script. That's why `'b' in window` evaluates to true and its not going into `if` block and prints `undefined` instead

```js
var a = 1;

function func() {
  a = 2;
  console.log(a);
  var a;
}

func(); // 2 (inside the func)

console.log(a); // 1 (outside value doesnt change)

if (!("b" in window)) {
  // b is present though its undefined
  var b = 1;
}

console.log(b); // undefined
```
