## Solution

```
1
3
```

## Explanation

When a [return](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped. But, If a return statement is executed within a `try` block, its `finally` block, if present, is first executed, before the value is actually returned.

In this example, when we invoke `func()` thy `try` block gets executed which logs 1 and returns. However, there is also a `finally` block present which gets executed before returning. Hence, 3 is also logged to the console.

```
function func() {
  try {
    console.log(1)
    return
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(2)
  } finally {
    console.log(3)
  }
  console.log(4)
}

func()

// 1
// 3
```
