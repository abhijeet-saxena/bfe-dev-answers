# Iterable

```js
const entries = [1, 2, 3, 4].entries();
for (const [, item] of entries) {
  console.log(item);
  break;
}
for (const [, item] of entries) {
  console.log(item);
  break;
}
```

## Solution

```
1
2
```

## Explanation

The [entries()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/entries) method returns a new array [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator) object that contains the key/value pairs for each index in the array. When we run the [for...of loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) over this iterable, it will repeatedly call the iterator's [next()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterator_protocol) method to produce the sequence of values i.e, in this case, the array elements 1,2,3 and 4 (since we have destructured the array elements as `item` in the `for...of` loop itself).

In the first `for...of`, it console logs 1 and then encounters a `break` statement causing the control to go outside the loop, but the iterator is not yet completely iterated. So in the second `for...of` it simply resumes from where we last stopped and prints the next array element i.e. 2 because the iterable is the same.

```js
const entries = [1, 2, 3, 4].entries();
for (const [, item] of entries) {
  console.log(item); // effectively the same as entries.next()
  break;
}
for (const [, item] of entries) {
  console.log(item);
  break;
}

// 1
// 2
```
