## Solution

```
banana
```

## Explanation

`+` is an operator that has different meaning depending on the context it is used. The [addition (+) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition) produces the sum of numeric operands or string concatenation. The [unary plus (+) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary_plus) precedes its operand and evaluates to its operand but attempts to convert it into a number, if it isn't already.

In this example, we actually have a space between two `+` operators. This resolves to having one being treated as concatenation and other being treated as unary operator. We know that converting a non-numerical string to a number returns [NaN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN) thus `+'b'` becomes `NaN`

Concatenating everything becomes `baNaNa` and converting it to lowercase results in `banana` üçå

```
console.log(('b' + 'a' + + 'b' + 'a').toLowerCase()) // "banana"

// 'b' + 'a' + (+'b') + 'a'
// 'ba' + NaN + 'a'
// 'baNaNa'.toLowerCase()
// 'banana'
```
