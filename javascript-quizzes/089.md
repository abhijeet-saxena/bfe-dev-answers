## Solution

```
2
```

## Explanation

```js
let a = 1;
(function () {
  let foo = () => a;
  let a = 2;
  console.log(foo()); // 2
})();
```

Here, inside the [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) the function foo simply returns `a`. Whenever we execute it, it'll return the value of `a` defined at that point.

In this example, even though `a` is assigned a value 2 after `foo` is declared it is still before `foo` is invoked. Thus, at the time of execution it prints 2
