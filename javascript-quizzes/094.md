## Explanation

JavaScript strings are represented using UTF-16 code units. Each code unit can be used to represent a code point in the [U+0000, U+FFFF] range – also known as the “basic multilingual plane” (BMP).

For code points beyond U+FFFF, you’d represent them as a surrogate pair. That is to say, two contiguous code units. For instance, the emoji '👍' code point is represented with the '\uD83D\uDC4D' contiguous code units.

[String.length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length) property returns the number of code units in the string. While this is usually the same as character length, using characters that are outside the BMP([U+0000, U+FFFF] range) can return a different length
