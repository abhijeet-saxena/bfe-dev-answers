# Hoisting I

```js
const a = 1;
console.log(a);

var b;
console.log(b);
b = 2;

console.log(c);
var c = 3;

console.log(d);
let d = 2;
```

## Solution

```
1
undefined
undefined
Error
```

## Explanation

```js
const a = 1;
console.log(a); // 1

var b;
console.log(b); // undefined
b = 2;

console.log(c); // undefined
var c = 3;

console.log(d); // Error
let d = 2;
```

`1.` Straightforward as `a` is 1

`2.` `b` is declared but not initialized so it prints `undefined`

> [Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) is the process whereby the interpreter moves the declaration of functions, variables, or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

`3.` JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations! This means that initialization doesn't happen until the associated line of code is executed. Hence, JS knows that `c` exists but its `undefined` at the point of printing its value

`4.` Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but, unlike `var`, are not initialized with a default value. Accessing the variable before the declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
