## Solution

```
"bfe.dev"
```

## Explanation

Starting from ECMAScript 5, a string can be treated as an array-like object, where individual characters correspond to a numerical index.

However, when using bracket notation for character access, <b>attempting to delete or assign a value to these properties will not succeed.</b> The properties involved are neither writable nor configurable.

```js
let a = "bfe.dev";
a[0] = "c"; // this will make no difference
console.log(a); // "bfe.dev"
```
