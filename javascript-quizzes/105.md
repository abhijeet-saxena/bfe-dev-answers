## Solution

```
"not a string"
```

## Explanation

> The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value.

Here we have defined a variable `a` of type `string`. Inside the if condition it looks like we are checking if typeof a is string or not and if its not string we go to the `if` block otherwise `else` block gets executed.

But that's not what is happening. In fact this code will always go into `else` block irrespective of the datatype of `a`. Take a look at the following statements

```js
!typeof a === "string"; // actually this is (!typeof a) === string
typeof a !== "string";
```

There is a difference between the above two statements. In the first one, we are actually doing [logical not](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_NOT) of the value returned from `typeof a` while in the second example we are evaluating if typeof a `not equals` string.

And since [typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) always returns a string (remember "string", "boolean" etc are in fact strings), logical not of a non-empty string will always be false. Hence, "false" compared to a "string" is gonna be `false`, which means the `if` block will never be executed.

```js
const a = "BFE.dev";
if (!typeof a === "string") {
  // false === "string" üëâüèª "false" === "string" üëâüèª false
  console.log("string");
} else {
  console.log("not a string");
}

// "not a string"
```
