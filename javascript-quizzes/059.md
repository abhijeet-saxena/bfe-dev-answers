# override setter

```js
class A {
  val = 1;
  get foo() {
    return this.val;
  }
}

class B {
  val = 2;
  set foo(val) {
    this.val = val;
  }
}
const a = new A();
const b = new B();
console.log(a.foo);
console.log(b.foo);
b.foo = 3;
console.log(b.val);
console.log(b.foo);
```

## Solution

```
1
undefined
3
undefined
```

## Explanation

Here, we have two classes defined. `A` has a property `val` initialized to 1 and a [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) `foo` defined. `B` also has a property `val` and a [setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) `foo`

Remember that, when we override the get method, it appears that the set method must also be overridden, otherwise undefined is returned and vice-versa [See this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28950760/override-a-setter-and-the-getter-must-also-be-overridden)

So, when we create two objects `a` and `b`; `a.foo` will return the value 1 as getter is defined but `b.foo` returns undefined.

Also, when we do `b.foo=3`, the setter works and val gets updated to 3. However, as there is no getter defined `b.foo` returns undefined. Note that, accessing `b.val` directly returns the new value 3 though

```js
class A {
  val = 1;
  get foo() {
    return this.val;
  }
}

class B {
  val = 2;
  set foo(val) {
    this.val = val;
  }
}

const a = new A();
const b = new B();
console.log(a.foo); // 1
console.log(b.foo); // undefined
b.foo = 3;
console.log(b.val); // 3
console.log(b.foo); // undefined
```
