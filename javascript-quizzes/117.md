## Solution

```
"BFE"
"bigfrontend"
```

## Explanation

The [static](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static) keyword defines a static method or field for a class that cannot be directly accessed on instances of the class but they're accessed on the class itself.

Here, class A defines two properties called `static dev` and `dev` both of which are inherited by sublass B

When we invoke `B.log` the static method gets invoked which references the static dev i.e. `BFE` while using `new B().log()` first creates an instance of `B` and then invokes `log` which will reference the property `dev` inherited from `A` thus logging `bigfrontend`

```js
class A {
  static dev = "BFE";
  dev = "bigfrontend";
}

class B extends A {
  log() {
    console.log(this.dev);
  }

  static log() {
    console.log(this.dev);
  }
}

B.log(); // "BFE"
new B().log(); // "bigfrontend"
```
