# Promise order

```js
console.log(1);
const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  console.log(2);
  resolve();
  console.log(3);
});

console.log(4);

promise
  .then(() => {
    console.log(5);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log(6);
  });

console.log(7);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(8);
}, 10);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(9);
}, 0);
```

## Solution

```
1
2
3
4
7
5
6
9
8
```

## Explanation

Key points to remember are-

1. The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Basically, its a non blocking block of code that executes when call stack is empty
2. The executor is called synchronously by the Promise constructor before even the Promise constructor returns the created object
3. `Promises` create `Microtask` which have priority over the `Macrotask` created by `setTimeout`.

In this example, `1`, `2` and `3` are called synchronously even though written inside a promise. `4` is printed in synchronous manner as well.

`5` and `6` get queued in Microtask queue

`7` get printed synchronously

`8` and `9` gets queued to macrotask queue (9 gets queued before 8 as its duration is less)

Once call stack is empty,
Microtask Queue contains `5,6` which have higher priority
Macrotask Queue contains `9,8`

`5`, `6` is then printed. Once Microtask queue is empty then `9` and `8` gets printed

```js
console.log(1);
const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  console.log(2); // this code runs synchronously
  resolve();
  console.log(3); // this code runs synchronously
});

console.log(4);

promise
  .then(() => {
    console.log(5);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log(6);
  });

console.log(7);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(8);
}, 10);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(9);
}, 0);

// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 7
// 5
// 6
// 9
// 8
```
