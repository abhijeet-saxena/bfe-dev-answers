# block scope

[Problem Link](https://bigfrontend.dev/quiz/block-scope-1)

## Explanation

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0);
}
// 5
// 5
// 5
// 5
// 5

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0);
}
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```

`var` has a functional scope when declared in a function and otherwise is globally scoped. `let` has a block scope which means it is only existing within the block.

The way to understand this imagine in each iteration we are declaring i using `var` and assigning the count, since we are just redeclaring i, the same variable keeps on updating, and ultimately when pending setTimeouts execute, they all will point to the shared variable.

However, in the case of `let` each iteration holds separate i and all setTimeouts have independent values of i.

If you have to use `var` and still avoid this problem, you can make use of `closures` and execute inner code in an `IIFE` as in â€”

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ((idx) => {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(idx), 0);
  })(i);
}

// OR

const func = (i) => {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0);
};
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  func(i);
}
```
