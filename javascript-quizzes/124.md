## Solution

```
3
```

## Explanation

The [comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator) (,) evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand.

This means, `a` is actually assigned the value `3` as it is the last operand; and when printed it logs 3

```javascript
const a = (1, 2, 3);
console.log(a); // 3
```
