## Solution

```
"bigfrontend"
undefined
```

## Explanation

When a function is called with the [new](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) keyword, the function will be used as a constructor. This means, first a new object is created, that new object is prototype linked, and the new object is set as `this` binding.

Lastly, a copy of this object is returned if no explicit return is present.

However, in this case, since we are returning an object from `A()`, this return value becomes the result of the whole `new` expression. Hence, `a.dev1` is actually `bigfrontend` and not `BFE`. Also, since returned object doesn't contain `dev2` property, it logs undefined

```js
function A() {
  this.dev1 = "BFE";
  this.dev2 = "dev";
  return {
    dev1: "bigfrontend",
  };
}

const a = new A();
console.log(a.dev1); // "bigfrontend"
console.log(a.dev2); // undefined
```
