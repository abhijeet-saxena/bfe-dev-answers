## Solution

```
0

```

## Explanation

Here we have a global `val` and then three classes. `A` has both [setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) and [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) defined. `B` extends `A` without any overriding. `C` extends `A` with `get foo()` overridden.

Note that since we have not used `this` keyword while setting, it'll actually update the outer variable `val`

So, when we create a new object b, the value of val is 0 and hence b.foo returns 0. Then we do `b.foo = 1` which means val also gets updated to 1 and hence it prints 1 next.

Next we create a new object c, c.foo returns 1 (from above). However, `c.foo = 2` will not update val as there is no setter defined hence val remains 1 thus printing 1 for both `c.foo` and `b.foo` Apparently, when we override the get method, it appears that the set method must also be overridden, otherwise undefined is returned [See this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28950760/override-a-setter-and-the-getter-must-also-be-overridden)

```js
let val = 0;

class A {
  set foo(_val) {
    val = _val;
  }
  get foo() {
    return val;
  }
}

class B extends A {}

class C extends A {
  get foo() {
    return val;
  }
}

const b = new B();
console.log(b.foo); // 0
b.foo = 1; // val also gets updated to 1
console.log(b.foo); // 1

const c = new C();
console.log(c.foo); // 1
c.foo = 2;
console.log(c.foo); // 1
console.log(b.foo); // 1
```
