# Promise executor II

```js
const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const p2 = new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p1));
const p3 = Promise.resolve(p1);
const p4 = p2.then(() => new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p3)));
const p5 = p4.then(() => p4);

console.log(p1 == p2);
console.log(p1 == p3);
console.log(p3 == p4);
console.log(p4 == p5);
```

## Solution

```
false
true
false
false
```

## Explanation

We know that for object comparisons to be true, the object reference should be same. Here, all the variables p1,p2,p3,p4,p5 store the Promise object, and their comparisons should return `false` as references are different.

However, the case of `p1 == p3` is `true` because of how Promise.resolve() works.

> [Promise.resolve()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve) returns a Promise object that is resolved with a given value. If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; otherwise, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value.

Since we are passing `p1` as an argument to `p3`, the same promise object gets returned and hence the reference is also the same.

```js
const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const p2 = new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p1));
const p3 = Promise.resolve(p1);
const p4 = p2.then(() => new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p3)));
const p5 = p4.then(() => p4);

console.log(p1 == p2); // false
console.log(p1 == p3); // true
console.log(p3 == p4); // false
console.log(p4 == p5); // false
```
