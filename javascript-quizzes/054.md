## Solution

```
1
0
2
```

## Explanation

`setTimeout()` method sets a timer that executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires. When this happens the handler gets pushed to a queue where they are executed one by one (if the call stack is empty)

Here, `2ms` is long enough for other timeouts to be pushed to the queue before it. However, `1ms` is not enough and is pushed earlier than even the following `0ms`.

Hence, `1` gets pushed first, then `0` and lastly `2`

This order is different in `Firefox` as the underlying implementation might be different. `0 -> 1 -> 2`

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(2);
}, 2);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(1);
}, 1);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(0);
}, 0);

// 1
// 0
// 2
```
