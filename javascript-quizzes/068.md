## Solution

```
"dev"
Error
```

## Explanation

Here, because we are using a function inside an `if` it's supposed to be evaluated as a boolean. Boolean(any function) is always `true`. So, if block gets through and `"dev"` gets printed.

In simple terms, `foo` gets evaluated and it exists for that evaluation step only. Unlike other normal function declarations `foo` will not get hoisted and will not be available to execute anywhere (not even inside that if block)

Trying to run `foo` after will give `ReferenceError: foo is not defined`

```js
if (
  function foo() {
    console.log("BFE");
  }
) {
  console.log("dev");
}
foo();

// "dev"
// Error
```
