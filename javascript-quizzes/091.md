```js
const arr = [];
arr[2 ** 32 - 2] = 1;
arr[2 ** 32 - 1] = 2;
console.log(arr.at(-1));
```

## Solution

```
1
```

## Explanation

The [at()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/at) method takes an integer value and returns the item at that index, allowing for positive and negative integers. Negative integers count back from the last item in the array. For the last item `array[array.length-1]`, you can also call `array.at(-1)`

JavaScript arrays are zero-based and use 32-bit indexes: the index of the first element is 0, and the highest possible index is 4294967294 (2^32 âˆ’ 2) which we have assigned as `1`

Accessing, `arr.at(-1)` thus returns the last element `1`.

Also, note that `arr[2^32 - 1] = 2` does store 2 at that index however since its more than the max possible length it cannot be accessed by `at`

```js
const arr = [];
arr[2 ** 32 - 2] = 1;
arr[2 ** 32 - 1] = 2;
console.log(arr.at(-1)); // 1
```
