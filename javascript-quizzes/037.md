## Solution

```
[5,6,1,2,3,4]
```

## Explanation

> The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array

> The `unshift()` method inserts one or more values to the beginning of an array.

The important thing to note is that, if multiple elements are passed as parameters, they're inserted as a chunk at the beginning, in the exact same order they were passed as parameters. This is different than adding it one by one.

```
const arr = [1,2]
arr.push(3,4)
arr.unshift(5,6)
console.log(arr) // [5,6,1,2,3,4]
```
