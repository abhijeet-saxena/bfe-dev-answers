# precedence

```js
let a = 1;
console.log(a++ + a);

let b = 1;
console.log(b + +(+b));

let c = 1;
console.log(c-- - c);

let d = 1;
console.log(d - -(-d));
```

## Solution

```
3
2
1
0
```

## Explanation

Whenever three unary operators are placed one after another it actually becomes a post-increment/decrement operator followed by another operator [See Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_munch)

But, if there are spaces between the operators, it actually means multiple unary operators one after another

Basically,

```js
a++ + a; // is same as (a++ + a)
a + +(+a); // is same as (a +  +(+a)) = a + a
```

Also, remember If used [postfix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment), with operator after operand (for example, x++), the increment operator increments and returns the value before incrementing.

```js
let a = 1;
console.log(a++ + a); // 3
// (a++  + a) = 1 + 2 = 3 (Note that a after + gets incremented)

let b = 1;
console.log(b + +(+b)); // 2
// (1 + +(+1)) = (1 + +1) = 1 + 1 = 2

let c = 1;
console.log(c-- - c); // 1
// (c--  - c) = 1 - 0 = 1 (Note that c after - gets decremented)

let d = 1;
console.log(d - -(-d)); // 0
// (1 - -(-1)) = (1 - 1) = 0
```
