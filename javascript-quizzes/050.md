## Explanation

An async function is a function declared with the [async keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), and the [await keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior.

Key points to remember are-

- All synchronous code gets executed first
- The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Basically, it's a nonblocking block of code that executes when the call stack is empty
- The executor is called synchronously by the Promise constructor before even the Promise constructor returns the created object
- `Promises` create `Microtask` which has priority over the `Macrotask` created by `setTimeout`.
- If the value of the expression following the await operator is not a Promise, it's converted to a resolved Promise i.e. await will also trigger an item into microtask queue

```js
async function async1() {
  console.log(1); // 2️⃣
  await async2();
  console.log(2); // 6️⃣
}

async function async2() {
  console.log(3); //  3️⃣
}

console.log(4); // 1️⃣

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(5); // 8️⃣
}, 0);

async1();

new Promise(function (resolve) {
  console.log(6); // 4️⃣
  resolve();
}).then(function () {
  console.log(7); // 7️⃣
});

console.log(8); // 5️⃣

// 4
// 1
// 3
// 6
// 8
// 2
// 7
// 5
```

So all code execution can be explained in these steps-

- `4` gets printed as its synchronous statement
- `5` is a setTimeout get pushed to the Macrotask queue
- `async1` gets called and `1` gets printed, then `async2` is invoked and `3` gets printed. `2` gets queued to Microtask queue
- `6` gets printed as it's synchronous inside executer function of the promise while `7` gets queued to Microtask queue
- `8` gets printed being synchronous
- Now since, the call stack is empty. Microtask queue is checked first and `2` and `7` gets printed
- Lastly, queued setTimeout get executed i.e. `5` will get printed

Note that, this order may vary in browsers because of underlying implementations. For example, the same code in Safari prints `4,1,3,6,8,7,2,5`
