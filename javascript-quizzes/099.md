## Solution

```
"BFE"
```

## Explanation

> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function

Here, a [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) is created when function `a` is defined such that the returned function within, maintains a reference to the function variable `dev = BFE` even after the function's execution is completed.

In this code snippet, we have an outer variable also, `dev` declared using `let` which is later reassigned to `bigfrontend`. However, when we execute the returned function with `a()()`, we are logging the closure value `"BFE"` irrespective of the outer `dev` value `bigfrontend`

```js
let dev = "bfe";

function a() {
  let dev = "BFE";
  return function () {
    console.log(dev);
  };
}

dev = "bigfrontend";

a()(); // "BFE"
```
