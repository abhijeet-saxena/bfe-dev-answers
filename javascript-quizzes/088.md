} catch {
  var a = "a1";
}
console.log(a);

var b = "b";
try {

## Solution

```
"a1"
"b"
"c1"
```

## Explanation

The [try...catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch#description) statement marks a `try` block and a `catch` block. If the code in the `try` block throws an exception then the code in the `catch` block will be executed. In all these examples, we are throwing an exception in `try` which is why the control immediately goes to the `catch` block.

The important thing to know is that the catch-block specifies an identifier that holds the value of the exception; <b>this value is only available in the scope of the catch-block</b>

```js
var a = "a";
try {
  throw new Error("BFE.dev");
} catch {
  // no local variable being used
  var a = "a1"; // overwrites outer varibale a, redeclaring global a
}
console.log(a); // a1

var b = "b";
try {
  throw new Error("BFE.dev");
} catch (b) {
  // local variable b references the passed error
  var b = "b1"; // No longer pointing to the global variable, its a locally scoped variable only
}
console.log(b); // b

var c = "c";
try {
  throw new Error("BFE.dev");
} catch (error) {
  // local variable error references the passed error
  var c = "c1"; // overwrites outer variable c, redeclaring global c
}
console.log(c); // c1
```

1. We have just written `catch` and are not even capturing the error parameter so
   `var a` declared inside actually becomes global and overwrites outer `a` hence printing `a1` later
2. We have written `catch(b)` which means we are using `b` to hold the exception value which is only available locally inside this catch block. Hence, even after declaring `b` inside, the global value remains unchanged. Thus, printing `b`
3. We have written `catch(error)` and are using `error` variable to capture the error value , so `error` is a locally scoped variable but `c` is not. Hence, similar to 1. `var c` declared inside actually becomes global and overwrites outer `c` hence printing `c1` later.
