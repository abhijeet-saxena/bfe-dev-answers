# Pick up stones

There is a pile of n (n > 0) stones.

Player A and Player B take turns to pick 1 or 2 stones from the pile. A starts first.

Who picks the last stone loses the game.

Now here is the question, is there a winning strategy for A or B ? If so, returns the player name. If there is none, return null.

> winningStonePicking(1) // 'B'<br>
> winningStonePicking(2) // 'A'<br>
> winningStonePicking(3) // 'A'<br>
> winningStonePicking(4) // 'B'
