# implement \`Promise.allSettled()\`

> The Promise.allSettled() method returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome of each promise.

Different from Promise.all() which rejects right away once an error occurs, Promise.allSettled() waits for all promises to settle.

Now can you implement your own allSettled() ?

`note` - Do not use Promise.allSettled() directly, it helps nothing.

```js
function allSettled(promises) {
  const op = [];
  let promisesToComplete = promises.length;

  return new Promise((res) => {
    if (!promises.length) res([]);

    for (let i in promises) {
      Promise.resolve(promises[i])
        .then((value) => {
          op[i] = { status: "fulfilled", value };
        })
        .catch((reason) => {
          op[i] = { status: "rejected", reason };
        })
        .finally(() => {
          if (!--promisesToComplete) res(op);
        });
    }
  });
}
```
