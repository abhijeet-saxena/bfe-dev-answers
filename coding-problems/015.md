# implement a simple DOM wrapper to support method chaining like jQuery

I believe you've used jQuery before, we often chain the jQuery methods together to accomplish our goals.

For example, below chained call turns button into a black button with white text.

```js
$("#button")
  .css("color", "#fff")
  .css("backgroundColor", "#000")
  .css("fontWeight", "bold");
```

The chaining makes the code simple to read, could you create a simple wrapper `$` to make above code work as expected?

The wrapper only needs to have `css(propertyName: string, value: any)`

```js
function $(el) {
  function f(prop, val) {
    el.style[prop] = val;
    return {
      css: f,
    };
  }
  return {
    css: f,
  };
}
```
