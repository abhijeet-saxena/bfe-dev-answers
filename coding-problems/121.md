# A number sequence

Here is a sequence:

1. `'1',` first number is 1
2. `'11',` since previous number has One(1) 1
3. `'21',` since previous number has Two(2) 1s
4. `'1211',` since previous number has One(1) 2 and One(1) 1
5. `'111221',` since previous number has One(1) 1, One(1) 2, Two(2) 1s
6. `'312211',` since previous number has Three(3) 1s, Two(2) 2s, One(1) 1
7. ....

As explained above, the sequence is generated by counting the digits of previous number.

Please create `getNthNum(n)`` to return the n-th number string in the sequence, n starts from 1.

````js
function getNthNum(n) {
  let nthNum = "1";

  while(n>1){
    let str = nthNum;
    let res = "";
    let lastchar = str[0];
    let lastcharCount = 1;

    for(let i=1; i<=str.length; i++){
      if(str[i] == lastchar){
        lastcharCount++;
      }else{
        res += `${lastcharCount}${lastchar}`
        lastchar = str[i];
        lastcharCount = 1;
      }
    }

    nthNum = res;
    n--
  }

  return nthNum
}```
