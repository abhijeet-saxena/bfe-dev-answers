# validate number string

Give a number string, check if it is valid number.

By "valid", we mean if it validates as one of below formats:

- integer, such as '0', '-1'
- decimal number like '1.0', '-2.335'
- exponential notation -12.3e45
- Formats such as BigInt, Infinity, NaN, octal and hexadecimal .etc are out of scope, you can treat them as invalid.
- Pay attention to the sign + -
