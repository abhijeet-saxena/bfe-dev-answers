# implement range()

Can you create a `range(from, to)` which makes following work?

> for (let num of range(1, 4)) {<br>
> console.log(num) <br>
> }<br>
> // 1<br>
> // 2<br>
> // 3<br>
> // 4

This is a simple one, could you think more fancy approaches other than for-loop?

Notice that you are not required to return an array, but something iterable would be fine.

```js
function range(fr, to) {
  return Array.from({ length: to - fr + 1 }, (k, i) => fr + i);
}
```
