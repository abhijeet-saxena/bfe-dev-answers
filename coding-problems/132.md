# the angle between hour hand and minute hand of a clock

Given a time string in format HH:mm, please return the angle between hour hand and minute hand.

You should return rounded integer representing the smaller angle in degrees.

> angle('12:00') // 0<br>
> angle('23:30') // 165

```js
function angle(time) {
  let [hr, min] = time.split(":").map((i) => +i);

  let hr_displacement = hr * 30 + min * 0.5;
  let mind_displacement = min * 6;

  let diff = hr_displacement - mind_displacement;

  if (diff >= 360) diff -= 360;
  if (diff >= 180) diff = 360 - Math.floor(diff);

  return Math.round(diff);
}
```
