# implement \`Promise.any()\`

> Promise.any() takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the promises in the iterable fulfils, returns a single promise that resolves with the value from that promise

Can you implement a any() to work the same as Promise.any()?

`note` - AggregateError is not supported in Chrome yet, but you can still use it in your code since we will add the Class into your code. Do something like following:

```js
new AggregateError("No Promise in Promise.any was resolved", errors);
```

```js
function any(promises) {
  const op = [];
  let promisesToComplete = promises.length;

  return new Promise((res, rej) => {
    if (!promises.length) {
      rej(new AggregateError("No Promise in Promise.any was resolved"));
    }

    for (let i in promises) {
      Promise.resolve(promises[i])
        .then(res)
        .catch((err) => (op[i] = err))
        .finally(() => {
          if (!--promisesToComplete) {
            rej(
              new AggregateError("No Promise in Promise.any was resolved", op)
            );
          }
        });
    }
  });
}
```
