# count "1" in binary form

Given an integer, count "1" in its binary form.

> countOne(1) // 1, "1"<br>
> countOne(257799) // 12, "111110111100000111"

- If you use built-in string methods in JavaScript, please do understand the time complexity, they are not free.
- Actually this could be easily done by counting the digit one by one. Could you think of some other approaches?

function countOne(num) {
  return (num.toString(2).match(/1/g) || []).length;
