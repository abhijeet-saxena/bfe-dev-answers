# Create a simple store for DOM element

We have `Map` in es6, so we could use any data as key, such as DOM element.

> const map = new Map()<br>
> map.set(domNode, somedata)

What if we need to support old JavaScript env like es5, how would you create your own Node Store as above?

You are asked to implement a Node Store, which supports DOM element as key.

```js
class NodeStore {
  set(node, value) {}
  get(node) {}
  has(node) {}
}
```

Map is disabled when judging your code, it is against the goal of practicing.

You can create a simple general Map polyfill. Or since you are asked to support specially for DOM element, what is special about DOM element?

What is the Time / Space cost of your solution?

```js
class NodeStore {
  constructor() {
    this.val = {};
  }

  set(node, value) {
    this.val[node.outerHTML.toString()] = value;
  }

  get(node) {
    return this.val[node.outerHTML.toString()];
  }

  has(node) {
    return node.outerHTML.toString() in this.val;
  }
}
```
