# implement \`Promise.race()\`

This problem is similar to 31. implement async helper - race(), but with Promise.

> The Promise.race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise. source: MDN

Can you create a race() which works the same as Promise.race()?

```js
function race(promises) {
  return new Promise((res, rej) => {
    for (let i in promises) {
      Promise.resolve(promises[i]).then(res).catch(rej);
    }
  });
}
```
