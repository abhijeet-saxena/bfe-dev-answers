# Implement a Stack by using Queue

In JavaScript, we could use array to work as both a Stack or a queue.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
arr.push(5); // now array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.pop(); // 5, now the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Above code is a Stack, while below is a Queue

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
arr.push(5); // now the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.shift(); // 1, now the array is [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

now suppose you have a Stack, which has only follow interface:

```js
class Stack {
  push(element) {
    /* add element to stack */
  }
  peek() {
    /* get the top element */
  }
  pop() {
    /* remove the top element */
  }
  size() {
    /* count of elements */
  }
}
```

Could you implement a Queue by using only above Stack? A Queue must have following interface

```js
class Queue {
  enqueue(element) {
    /* add element to queue, similar to Array.prototype.push */
  }
  peek() {
    /* get the head element*/
  }
  dequeue() {
    /* remove the head element, similar to Array.prototype.pop */
  }
  size() {
    /* count of elements */
  }
}
```

`note` - you can only use Stack as provided. Don't use Array, it is not what this is for.

```js
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.s1 = new Stack();
    this.s2 = new Stack();
  }

  enqueue(element) {
    while (this.s1.size()) {
      this.s2.push(this.s1.pop());
    }
    this.s1.push(element);
    while (this.s2.size()) {
      this.s1.push(this.s2.pop());
    }
  }

  peek() {
    return this.s1.peek();
  }

  size() {
    return this.s1.size();
  }

  dequeue() {
    return this.s1.pop();
  }
}
```
