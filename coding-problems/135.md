# localStorage with expiration

`localStorage` is a simple and handy client-side storage, but you should avoid using it because it is synchronous.

Also Safari's ITP actually deletes client-side script-writable storage after 7 days of Safari use without interacting on your website, and localStorage is included.

Unlike Cookie, localStorage doesn't expire.

In this problem, please create a `localStorage wrapper` with expiration support

> myLocalStorage.setItem('bfe', 'dev', 1000)<br>
> myLocalStorage.getItem('bfe') // 'dev'<br>
> after 1 second:<br>
> myLocalStorage.getItem('bfe') // null<br>

`FYI` - localStorage is replaced with our own implementation to avoid security error. But the interface is the same, actually you don't need to care :)

```js
window.myLocalStorage = {
  getItem(key) {
    return localStorage.getItem(key);
  },

  setItem(key, value, maxAge) {
    localStorage.setItem(key, value);
    if (maxAge !== undefined) {
      if (!maxAge) localStorage.removeItem(key);
      setTimeout(() => {
        localStorage.removeItem(key);
      }, maxAge);
    }
  },

  removeItem(key) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  },

  clear() {
    localStorage.clear();
  },
};
```
