# create a tokenizer

Given a character sequence and a defined document unit, tokenization is the task of chopping it up into pieces, called tokens , perhaps at the same time throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation.

For tasks of string processing, in many cases we are given a string, and are asked to understand this string in specific logic and then return the result.

For example, if we are to calculate the result of following expression: `1 * (20 - 300 )`

before we implement the logic, first we need to get the "keywords"(tokens) and ignore the spaces, like following:

> '1','\*', '(', '20', '-', '300', ')'

Then we can process above tokens and get the result easier.

You are asked to implement a tokenize() for arithmetic expression , which works as below:

> const tokens = tokenize(' 1 \* (20 - 300 ) ')<br>
> while (true) {<br>
> let token = tokens.next()<br>
> if (token.done) {<br>
> break<br>
> }<br>
> console.log(token.value)<br>
> }

or you can use for ... of

> for (let token of tokens) {<br>
> console.log(token) <br>
> }

Because it is trivial, in a real interview you talk to interviewer and implement tokenizer later, this could save yourself some time for more important tasks.

input only contains valid non-negative integers with +, -, \*, /, (, ) and spaces, space should be ignored.

your method should return an Generator object.

```js
function* tokenize(str) {
  let b = str.replaceAll(/ */g, "");
  const nums = b.split(/[\+\-\/\*\(\)]/g) || [];
  const brackets = b.match(/[\+\-\/\*\(\)]/g) || [];

  let i = 0,
    j = 0;

  while (i < nums.length || j < brackets.length) {
    if (nums[i] !== undefined && nums[i].trim() !== "") {
      yield nums[i];
    }
    if (brackets[j] !== undefined && brackets[j].trim() !== "") {
      yield brackets[j];
    }
    i++;
    j++;
  }
}
```
