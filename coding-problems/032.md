# implement \`Promise.all()\`

> The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises

Could you write your own all() ? which should works the same as Promise.all()

`note` - Do not use Promise.all() directly, it is not helping

```js
function all(promises) {
  const op = [];
  let promisesToComplete = promises.length;

  return new Promise((res, rej) => {
    if (!promises.length) res([]);

    for (let i in promises) {
      Promise.resolve(promises[i])
        .then((data) => {
          op[i] = data;
          if (!--promisesToComplete) res(op);
        })
        .catch(rej);
    }
  });
}
```
