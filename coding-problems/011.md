# what is Composition? create a pipe()

what is Composition? It is actually not that difficult to understand, see [@dan_abramov's explanation](https://whatthefuck.is/composition).

Here you are asked to create a `pipe()` function, which chains multiple functions together to create a new function.

Suppose we have some simple functions like this

```js
const times = (y) => (x) => x * y;
const plus = (y) => (x) => x + y;
const subtract = (y) => (x) => x - y;
const divide = (y) => (x) => x / y;
```

Your `pipe()` would be used to generate new functions

```js
pipe([times(2), times(3)]);
// x * 2 * 3

pipe([times(2), plus(3), times(4)]);
// (x * 2 + 3) * 4

pipe([times(2), subtract(3), divide(4)]);
// (x * 2 - 3) / 4
```

`notes` - to make things simple, functions passed to pipe() will all accept 1 argument

```js
function pipe(funcs) {
  return (input) => funcs.reduce((acc, curr) => curr(acc), input);
}
```
