# implement debounce() with leading & trailing option

This is a follow up on 6. In this problem, you are asked to implement an enhanced ` debounce()`` which accepts third parameter,  `option: {leading: boolean, trailing: boolean}`. The default case with {leading: false, trailing: true}.

1. leading: whether to invoke right away
2. trailing: whether to invoke after the delay.

for example, debouncing by 3 dashes

```
─ A ─ B ─ C ─ ─ D ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ E ─ ─ F ─ G
```

with {leading: false, trailing: true}, we get as below

```
─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ D ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ G
```

with {leading: true, trailing: true}:

```
─ A ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ D ─ ─ ─ E ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ G
```

with {leading: true, trailing: false}

```
─ A ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ E
```

with {leading: false, trailing: false}, of course, nothing happens.

### notes

- please follow above spec. the behavior might not be exactly the same as `lodash.debounce()`

- because `window.setTimeout` and `window.clearTimeout` are not accurate in browser environment, they are replaced to other implementation when judging your code. They still have the same interface, and internally keep track of the timing for testing purpose.

````js
function debounce(func, delay, options) {
  let timer = null;
  let hasStarted = false;
  const { leading=false, trailing=true } = options || {};

  return function(...args){
    const that = this;

    if (leading && !timer && !hasStarted)  {
      func.call(that, ...args);
      hasStarted = true;
      return;
    }

    clearTimeout(timer);

    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      hasStarted = false;
      timer = null;
      if (trailing) func.call(that, ...args);
    }, delay)
  }
}```
