# implement \`Math.pow()\`

Can you write your own Math.pow() ? The power would only be integers.

> pow(1, 2)// 1<br>
> pow(2, 10)// 1024<br>
> pow(4, -1)// 0.25

All inputs are safe.

`Follow-up`

You can easily solve this problem by multiplying the base one after another, but it is slow. For power of n, it is needed to do the multiplication n times, can you think of a faster solution ?

```js
function pow(base, power) {
  if (power === 0) return 1;
  if (power === 1) return base;
  if (power === 2) return base * base;

  let p1 = pow(base, parseInt(power / 2));

  if (power < 0) p1 = 1 / p1;

  return power % 2 === 0 ? p1 * p1 : p1 * p1 * base;
}
```
