# Cookie vs localStorage vs sessionStorage

this article would save the day if you are not familiar.

Knowing Secure and httpOnly of cookie, and also the ITP of safari would be a shining point.

## Answer

[Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie), [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), and [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) are all mechanisms for storing data in a web browser, but they have different purposes, lifetimes, and security characteristics.

### Cookie

Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent by the server and stored in the browser. They are often used for user authentication, tracking user behavior, and maintaining user sessions.

```javascript
// Creating a secure and httpOnly cookie
document.cookie =
  "myCookie=myValue; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2023 23:59:59 GMT; secure; HttpOnly";
```

- **Lifetime**: Cookies can have an expiration date or be session-only (deleted when the browser is closed).
- **Security**:
  - **Secure**: You can mark a cookie as "secure" to ensure it's only sent over HTTPS connections.
  - **httpOnly**: You can mark a cookie as "httpOnly" to prevent it from being accessed via JavaScript, enhancing security against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### localStorage

localStorage provides a way to store key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration time. Data is persistent across browser sessions and tabs.

```javascript
// Storing data in localStorage
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Retrieving data from localStorage
const value = localStorage.getItem("key");
```

- **Lifetime**: Data persists until explicitly removed or cleared by the user.
- **Security**: localStorage data is accessible via JavaScript in the same domain, which makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

### sessionStorage

sessionStorage is similar to localStorage but has a shorter lifetime. Data is available only for the duration of a page session (until the page is closed or refreshed).

```javascript
// Storing data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Retrieving data from sessionStorage
const value = sessionStorage.getItem("key");
```

- **Lifetime**: Data is cleared when the page session ends.
- **Security**: Like localStorage, sessionStorage data is accessible via JavaScript in the same domain and is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

#### Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP):

Safari's ITP is a privacy feature that limits cross-site tracking by restricting the use of cookies and other storage mechanisms, especially for third-party domains. It can impact how cookies and other storage options work in Safari.

To address ITP, you may need to consider using alternatives like `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for client-side storage when dealing with Safari users, but be aware that these storage mechanisms also have limitations imposed by ITP.
