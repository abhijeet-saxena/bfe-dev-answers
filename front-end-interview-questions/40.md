## Answer

[React Fiber](https://blog.logrocket.com/deep-dive-react-fiber/) is an internal architecture and algorithm in the React library that was introduced to improve the way React manages the rendering and updating of user interfaces.

### What was the problem ?

In earlier versions of React (known as "Stack Reconciliation"), rendering and updating the DOM could be a time-consuming process. React would attempt to complete a full tree reconciliation in a single go, potentially causing the main JavaScript thread to block.

Also, React had limited control over when and how updates were processed, which could lead to slow frame rates and a poor user experience.

### How it works ?

> React Fiber introduces a new way of handling the reconciliation process. Instead of relying on synchronous, recursive algorithms, it uses a more lightweight, asynchronous, and priority-based approach.

The key concepts in React Fiber include:

- **Fiber:** A "fiber" is a lightweight unit of work in React Fiber. Each component in the React tree corresponds to a fiber. These fibers can be paused, resumed, or aborted, allowing React to prioritize different tasks.
- **Reconciliation:** React Fiber breaks down the reconciliation process into smaller, interruptible units of work. It can pause and resume work on different parts of the component tree to ensure a smoother user experience.
- **Prioritization:** React Fiber introduces a priority system that allows React to prioritize high-priority updates (e.g., user interactions) over less critical updates. This helps in maintaining a responsive user interface.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Updates the count state when the button is clicked.
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, React Fiber would work on scheduling updates and rendering changes. The work is broken down into smaller units, and the priority system ensures that user interactions, like button clicks, are processed with higher priority, resulting in a more responsive UI.
