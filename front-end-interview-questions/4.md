# what is Closure and how does it work?

Closure is a common term in JavaScript.

The definition is easy, but you should explain well on details about how closure works.

## Answer

A [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) is a function that has access to variables from its surrounding lexical scope, even after that scope has exited.

This means that a closure "closes over" or captures the variables from its outer function, allowing it to retain and access those variables, even if the outer function has completed execution.

Here's how closures work:

1. **Defining a Function**: You define a function inside another function, where the inner function accesses one or more variables from the outer function's scope.
2. **Execution Context**: When the outer function is called, it creates an execution context, which includes variables and their values.
3. **Inner Function**: The inner function captures references to the variables it needs from the outer function's execution context.
4. **Outer Function Returns**: The outer function may return the inner function as a value.
5. **Accessing Variables**: Even after the outer function has completed execution, the inner function (closure) can still access and use the variables it captured from the outer function's scope.

### Example

```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
  // This inner function is a closure because it captures the 'x' variable.
  function innerFunction(y) {
    return x + y; // It can access 'x' from the outer function.
  }
  return innerFunction;
}

const closureExample = outerFunction(10); // 'closureExample' now holds the inner function.

console.log(closureExample(5)); // Outputs 15 because it adds 10 (captured from outerFunction) to 5.
```

In this example:

- `outerFunction` takes a parameter `x` and defines `innerFunction` within it.
- `innerFunction` captures `x` from its parent scope (`outerFunction`) and adds it to the value `y` passed as an argument.
- `outerFunction` returns `innerFunction`, and we assign it to the variable `closureExample`.
- When we call `closureExample(5)`, it still has access to the `x` variable (which is 10) even though `outerFunction` has completed execution.

Closures are powerful because they allow for data encapsulation and can be used for various programming tasks like creating private variables, implementing callbacks, and more.
