## Answer

While this kind of question is a bit uncommon in interviews, this question aims to draw out a more personal and human side of the candidate, providing a fuller picture beyond their professional qualifications and experiences. Here's how I would answer it‚Äî

The best gift I have ever received is from a close friend as a housewarming gift when I moved into a new house. The gift contained a wind-chime, chocolates, table lamp, air purifier and a cozy blanket. This list seems random but when you think about it its actually a gift for each of the 5 senses humans have.

- Wind chime **(Hear)**
- Chocolates **(Taste)**
- Table Lamp **(Vision)**
- Air Purifier **(Smell)**
- Blanket **(Touch)**

The thoughtfulness behind each of the items made it a very well-thought gift üëè
