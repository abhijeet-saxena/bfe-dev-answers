## Answer

[Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) are CSS selectors that allow you to target specific parts of HTML elements based on their state or position within the document. They are denoted by a colon (:) followed by a keyword.

### Pseudo-Classes:

Pseudo-classes target elements based on their state or user interaction. Common examples include `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, and `:nth-child`.

```css
/* Target a link when the mouse is over it */
a:hover {
  color: red;
}

/* Target an input element when it's focused */
input:focus {
  border-color: blue;
}

/* Target even-numbered list items */
li:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```

### Pseudo-Elements

Pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element, such as the first line or the first letter. They are denoted by a double colon (::) followed by a keyword. Common examples include `::before`, `::after`, and `::first-line`.

```css
/* Insert content before an element */
p::before {
  content: "Before Text: ";
}

/* Style the first letter of a paragraph */
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: blue;
}

/* Style the first line of a paragraph */
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
