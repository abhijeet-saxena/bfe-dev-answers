# What is XSS? How to prevent it?

Two common security problem in Web Front End, one is CSRF, the other one is XSS.

Other than sanitizing, mentioning CSP header would shine you out.

This article explains clearly on this issue in case you forgot.

## Answer

> [XSS, or Cross-Site Scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting), is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code.

This malicious code can execute within the context of the victim's browser, leading to various attacks, such as stealing user data, session hijacking, defacement of websites, and more.

### Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the server, and all users who view the affected page are vulnerable.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The injected script is reflected off a web server, such as in the URL, and executed immediately in the victim's browser. This type often involves social engineering to trick the victim into clicking a link.
3. **DOM-based XSS**: The attack occurs entirely on the client-side, with the malicious script manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. This type is often more difficult to detect and prevent.

### Prevention

1] **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized before being displayed on a web page. This includes escaping or encoding special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, and quotes.

```javascript
const userInput = "<script>alert('XSS');</script>";
const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = sanitizedInput;
```

2] **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: CSP is an HTTP header that helps mitigate XSS attacks by defining the sources from which certain content, such as scripts, can be executed on a web page. You can specify trusted sources and disallow inline scripts.

```html
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src trusted-scripts.com;
```

In this example, the `script-src` directive restricts scripts to be loaded only from the "trusted-scripts.com" domain, and `default-src` specifies that other content should be loaded from the same origin (the 'self' keyword).

3] **Output Encoding**: Encode user-generated content appropriately when rendering it in HTML, JavaScript, or other contexts. Use functions like [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) or output encoding libraries to ensure data is displayed as data, not code.

4] **Use Security Libraries**: Utilize security libraries like [OWASP's AntiSamy](https://owasp.org/www-project-antisamy/), [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify), or various language-specific libraries that can help you prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

5] **Regular Security Testing**: Regularly perform security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities.
