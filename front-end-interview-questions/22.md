# What is HTTP Cache? How does it work?

This is a huge topic. Besides the basic knowledge, maybe a real case of best practice would make the conversation smoother to proceed.

In case you are not familiar, read the following articles first.

## Answer

[HTTP caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching) is a technique used in web development and networking to store and reuse previously fetched or computed resources, such as web pages, images, and other web content.

The primary goal of HTTP caching is to improve website performance, reduce server load, and decrease latency by minimizing the need to repeatedly download the same resources.

When a user requests a resource, the system checks whether a cached copy of that resource exists and whether it is still valid. If a valid cached copy is found, it can be used instead of making a new request to the origin server, saving time and bandwidth.

### Inner Workings

**Request**: When a user's browser or a client sends an HTTP request for a resource, it includes an HTTP request header called "If-Modified-Since" or "If-None-Match." This header contains information about the previous version of the resource.

**Server Response**: The server receiving the request checks whether the requested resource has been modified since the last time it was cached or if the ETag (entity tag) has changed. If the resource hasn't changed, the server responds with a "304 Not Modified" status code and an empty body.

**Cache Validation**: If the server indicates that the resource has not been modified, the client or intermediate caching server can reuse the cached copy. If the resource has changed, the server sends a "200 OK" status code, and the client can replace the old cached version with the new one.

### Types Of Cache

**Browser Cache**: Each user's web browser maintains a cache of previously visited web pages, images, stylesheets, and scripts. This cache helps the browser load web pages faster on subsequent visits.

**Proxy Server Cache**: Intermediary servers, like proxy servers and CDNs, can cache resources on behalf of multiple clients. This reduces the load on the origin server and improves response times for clients.

**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: CDNs distribute cached copies of resources to multiple edge servers located geographically closer to users. This minimizes latency and enhances web performance for global audiences.

### Headers used to control caching

- `Cache-Control`: Specifies caching directives for both clients and servers.
- `Expires`: Defines an absolute expiration time for a resource.
- `Last-Modified`: Indicates the last modification timestamp of a resource.
- `ETag`: Provides a unique identifier for a resource's version.
