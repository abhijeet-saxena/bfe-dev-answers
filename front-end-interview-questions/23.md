# How to communicate between Webview and Native Client?

Front End Engineers create WebView apps in native client as well as browser based web applications. Communication between WebView and Native is a common scenario.

It is a pretty important topic. In case you are now familiar, this article might help.

From the perspective from WebView, how do you make sure that the messages sent to Native Client are received and handled ? The message might be dropped because of reasons out of our control, how do we handle it.

## Answer

Communication between a WebView (the web content) and a Native Client (the host application) can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as JavaScript and native code interfaces.

- JavaScript Bridge: Establish a JavaScript bridge that allows communication between the WebView and Native Client. You can do this by exposing JavaScript functions from the WebView to be called by native code.
- Native API: Implement a native API in your application that the WebView can invoke using JavaScript. This API should handle the messages sent from the WebView.

**Callback Mechanism**: Include a callback mechanism that allows the native client to respond to the WebView with the result or an acknowledgment of the message. Provide error callbacks or timeout mechanisms to handle scenarios where a response is not received.

**Error Handling**: When sending messages from the WebView, check for success or failure conditions, and if an error occurs, handle it gracefully. Ensure that you provide meaningful error messages or status codes when responding to the WebView.

**Message Queues**: Implement message queues or message buffering mechanisms to store messages temporarily if the communication channel is not available.

**Offline Handling**: Implement strategies such as caching messages and attempting to send them when connectivity is restored.

**Message Confirmation**: Implement a mechanism to confirm that a message has been successfully received and processed by the native client.

**Testing and Monitoring**: Thoroughly test scenarios where messages may be dropped or fail to send. Implement monitoring and logging to track the status of messages sent between the clients.

**Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for sending messages from the WebView if they are not acknowledged by the native client within a specified period.

**Security Considerations**: Validate and sanitize input from the WebView to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

**Cross-platform Considerations**: If your application targets multiple platforms, ensure that your communication mechanism works consistently across all platforms.
