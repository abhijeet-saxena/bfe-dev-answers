# `var` vs `let` vs `const`

The biggest difference is about the variable scope, so you should understand it first.

Before you start explaining the difference, it is recommended to talk about your general rule on which to use in common cases.

Then you can start talking about the technical difference between var, let and const

## Answer

### var

> [var](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) declares function-scoped or globally-scoped variables, optionally initializing each to a value.

- Function-scoped: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined or globally if declared outside of any function.
- Hoisting: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means you can use them before they are declared in the code, although their value will be `undefined`.

```javascript
function exampleVarScope() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // 10 (accessible outside the block)
}

console.log(x); // Error - x is not defined outside the function
```

### let

> [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) declaration declares re-assignable, block-scoped local variables, optionally initializing each to a value.

- Block-scoped: Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing block (commonly a `{}` block, like in loops or conditionals) where they are defined.
- Hoisting: Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted but not initialized, so referencing them before their declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
function exampleLetScope() {
  if (true) {
    let y = 20;
  }
  console.log(y); // Error - y is not defined outside the block
}
```

### const

> [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) declaration declares block-scoped local variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment using the assignment operator, but if a constant is an object, its properties can be added, updated, or removed.

- Block-scoped: Like `let`, variables declared with `const` are block-scoped.
- Constant value: Variables declared with `const` must be assigned a value when declared, and that value cannot be changed or reassigned after initialization.

```javascript
const z = 30;
// z = 40; // Error - cannot reassign a const variable
```

#### General Rule:

- Use `const` when the variable's value will not change after initialization. This is the preferred choice when possible because it makes your code more predictable and helps prevent accidental reassignments.
- Use `let` when the variable's value may change after initialization and when you need to reassign the variable.
- Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript unless you have a specific reason to use it. `var` has a wider scope compared to `let` and `const`, and it can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs due to hoisting.
