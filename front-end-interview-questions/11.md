# How HTTP works ? What is HTTP/2?

As FrontEnd engineers, we'd better understand how HTTP works.

In case you are not familiar, here are some materials

HTTP/2 helps with the performance improvement of resource loading. It could be a shining point if you can integrate this in your answers on general questions on performance tuning.

## Answer

## HTTP

> [HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet.

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and is used for retrieving web pages, images, videos, and other resources.

1. **Client Request**: When you enter a URL into your web browser and press Enter, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server associated with that URL. This request typically includes information like the method, the specific resource requested, and other headers with information about the client.
2. **Server Response**: The web server receives the HTTP request, processes it, and sends back an HTTP response. This response includes a status code, headers with metadata about the response, and the actual data.
3. **Client Rendering**: The client (usually a web browser) receives the response and renders it for the user to see. If the response includes HTML, the browser parses it to create the visual web page, making additional requests for other resources as needed.

## HTTP/2

> [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2) is the second major version of the HTTP protocol, designed to address some of the performance limitations of HTTP/1.1.

- **Multiplexing**: In HTTP/1.1, each resource request required a separate TCP connection. HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection.
- **Header Compression**: HTTP/2 uses header compression techniques like HPACK, which significantly reduce the size of header data sent in each request and response.
- **Server Push**: With HTTP/2, servers can proactively push resources to the client before they are requested. For example, if a server knows that a web page requires certain files, it can push those resources to the client as soon as the HTML is requested.
- **Stream Prioritization**: HTTP/2 allows for prioritizing resources. This means that critical resources can be assigned higher priority, ensuring they are loaded before less critical ones.
- **Binary Protocol**: Unlike HTTP/1.1, which uses plain text for communication, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, which is more efficient to parse and transmit.

In summary, HTTP/2 improves web performance by optimizing the way data is transmitted between clients and servers. It reduces latency, minimizes overhead, and provides more efficient resource loading, resulting in faster web page rendering and a better user experience.
