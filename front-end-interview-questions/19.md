# What does header `Connection:Keep-Alive` do?

You need to talk about how keep-alive help with performance in http/1.1.

And it is a shining point to mention multiplexing in http/2

## Answer

> The [Keep-Alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive) general header allows the sender to hint about how the connection may be used to set a timeout and a maximum amount of requests.

It is used to indicate that the connection between the client (typically a web browser) and the server should be kept open for multiple requests and responses instead of being closed after a single request-response cycle.

### How it helps in performance ?

**Reduced Latency:** Keep-Alive allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over the same connection (without it each request-response cycle required establishing a new TCP connection every time which introduced significant latency)

**Resource Efficiency:** Keeping the connection open reduces the need to allocate CPU and memory resources for connection management on both the client and server. This efficiency is very important as all the resources can be fetched over a single connection.

**Faster Page Loading:** Using Keep-Alive can lead to faster page loading times as resources can be downloaded in parallel over the same connection.

### How HTTP/2 made keep-alive unnecessary ?

**Multiplexing:** Multiple requests and responses can be multiplexed over a single TCP connection. This means that instead of sending requests sequentially, multiple requests can be sent concurrently, and their corresponding responses can be received in any order.

**Header Compression:** Header compression techniques significantly reduce the size of headers sent with each request and response.

**Prioritization:** Clients can specify the priority of requests, indicating which resources are more important. Servers can use this information to prioritize the delivery of critical assets

**Server Push:** This allows the server to proactively send resources to the client before the client requests them.
