# Explain `new` operator in JavaScript. What exactly does it do?

It is not enough to answer that new operator is to create an object, rather you should explain the exact steps in details.

There is also a coding problem for this on bfe.dev 60. create your own new operator

## Answer

> The [new](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

Here's a summary of the new operator's steps:

1. Allocate memory for a new object.
2. Invoke the constructor function or class constructor, setting the newly created object as this.
3. Set the [[Prototype]] of the new object to the constructor's prototype.
4. Execute the constructor code, allowing you to initialize instance-specific properties.
5. Implicitly return the new object.
6. Access and use the newly created instance.
7. Using the new operator is fundamental for creating instances of objects and working with object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

### Constructor Function Example:

```javascript
// Define a constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Create an instance using the 'new' keyword
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);

// Access instance properties
console.log(person1.name); // Output: "Alice"
console.log(person1.age); // Output: 30
```

In this example, the `new` keyword is used to create an instance of the `Person` constructor function, which sets the `name` and `age` properties on the newly created object.

### ES6 Class Example:

```javascript
// Define a class
class Animal {
  constructor(name, species) {
    this.name = name;
    this.species = species;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

// Create an instance using the 'new' keyword
const cat = new Animal("Whiskers", "Cat");

// Access instance properties and methods
console.log(cat.name); // Output: "Whiskers"
console.log(cat.species); // Output: "Cat"
cat.makeSound(); // Output: "Some generic animal sound"
```

In this example, the `new` keyword is used to create an instance of the `Animal` class, which has a constructor to set the `name` and `species` properties and a `makeSound` method.
