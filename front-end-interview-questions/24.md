## Answer

The [TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP) 3-way handshake is a process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices, typically a client and a server, before they can exchange data.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the TCP 3-way handshake process:

1. **Client Sends a SYN (Synchronize) Packet**: When the client wants to initiate a connection with the server it sends a TCP packet with the `SYN` flag set to the server indicating the client's intent to establish a connection.
2. **Server Responds with SYN-ACK Packet**: Upon receiving the `SYN` packet, the server acknowledges the client's request by sending a TCP packet back. This packet has the `SYN` and `ACK` (Acknowledge) flags set. The `ACK` flag indicates the server's acknowledgment of the client's request, and the `SYN` flag indicates its intent to establish a connection.
3. **Client Acknowledges with an ACK Packet**: Once the client receives the `SYN-ACK` packet from the server, it sends an acknowledgment (`ACK`) packet back to the server. This packet has the `ACK` flag set and acknowledges the receipt of the server's response.

Here's a summary of the flags used in each step:

> **SYN (Synchronize)**: Indicates the start of a connection request.

> **ACK (Acknowledge)**: Acknowledges the receipt of a packet or confirms a connection establishment.

After the 3-way handshake is complete, both the client and server can start exchanging data in a reliable and orderly manner. If any of the packets in the handshake process are lost, the sender will retransmit them until a successful handshake is established.
