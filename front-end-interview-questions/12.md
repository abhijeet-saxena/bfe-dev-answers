# How does HTTPS work?

Well, this is rarely asked in general FrontEnd interview, but it is highly recommended that you understand how https works.

This might be very useful when you deal with Node.js applications or security-related work.

## Answer

> [HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS) is a secure version of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) used for secure communication over the internet.

HTTPS works by encrypting the data exchanged between a user's web browser and a web server, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and protected from eavesdropping and tampering. It uses [TLS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) to encrypt all communication between a client and a server.

### How it works ?

1. **Handshake and Key Exchange:**
   When a user attempts to access a website that uses HTTPS, the browser initiates a connection to the web server. The server responds by sending its digital certificate, which contains its public key and some other information. The browser then verifies the certificate's authenticity by checking if it was issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and that it has not expired or been revoked.
2. **Session Key Generation:**
   Once the browser trusts the server's certificate, it generates a random session key, which is a symmetric encryption key. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt data during the current session. The browser encrypts this session key using the server's public key from the certificate and sends it back to the server.
3. **Key Exchange Complete:**
   The server receives the encrypted session key, decrypts it using its private key (which only the server possesses), and retrieves the session key. Both the browser and the server now have the same session key, which they will use for encrypting and decrypting data.
4. **Secure Data Transfer:**
   With the session key established, the browser and server can now communicate securely. They use symmetric encryption algorithms, like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), to encrypt and decrypt the data being exchanged. This ensures that even if a malicious actor intercepts the data during transit, they cannot decipher it without the session key.
5. **Data Integrity and Authentication:**
   Along with encryption, HTTPS also provides data integrity and authentication. Data integrity means that the data remains unchanged during transmission, and authentication ensures that users are connected to the genuine website and not a malicious imposter. This is achieved through cryptographic hashing and digital signatures.
6. **Browser Verification:**
   The browser continues to monitor the certificate throughout the session to ensure it's still valid. If there are any issues with the certificate, such as expiration or revocation, the browser will display a warning to the user.
7. **Termination of Session:**
   When the user finishes their interaction with the website or logs out, the session key is discarded, ensuring that subsequent interactions require the establishment of a new secure connection.
