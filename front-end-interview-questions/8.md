# difference between `==` and `===`

The answer could be very shortã€‚

But if you want to impress the interviewer, you can talk about how exactly Type Conversion works.

Besides, Object to primitive conversion is also a good reading material

## Answer

In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are used to compare values, but they have different behaviors due to how they handle type conversion:

**== ([Equality Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality)):** checks for equality of values but performs type coercion (conversion) if the operands are of different types. It converts the operands to a common type before making the comparison.

```javascript
5 == "5"; // true, because it converts the string to a number and compares
1 == true; // true, because it converts true to 1 and compares
0 == false; // true, because it converts false to 0 and compares
```

**=== ([Strict Equality Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality)):** checks for equality of values without performing type conversion. It compares the values and the types of the operands, ensuring both must be identical for the comparison to be true.

```javascript
5 === "5"; // false, because values are equal, but types (number and string) are different
1 === true; // false, because types (number and boolean) are different
0 === false; // false, because types (number and boolean) are different
```

### Object to Primitive Conversion:

In JavaScript, when you use an object in a context where a primitive value is expected (e.g., in arithmetic operations or when comparing to a primitive value), JavaScript performs an implicit object-to-primitive conversion.

Object to primitive conversion in JavaScript allows you to control how an object is converted to a primitive value in various contexts. This can be controlled by defining two methods on your object: `toString` and `valueOf`.

```javascript
const obj = {
  valueOf: function () {
    return 42; // This method is called for numeric operations
  },
  toString: function () {
    return "Hello"; // This method is called for string operations
  },
};

console.log(obj + 2); // 44, because valueOf is called for numeric operation
console.log(obj + " World"); // "Hello World", because toString is called for string operation
```

In this example, the `valueOf` method is used when performing numeric operations, and the `toString` method is used when performing string operations.
