# How could you do to improve performance in React?

This is a question without absolute right answer.

Please recall the project you worked on with React, and list up those approaches of performance tuning.

If no React experience, general web app performance tuning approach is OK.

## Answer

Here are some common techniques to achieve better performance:

1. **Use Functional Components**: Functional components are generally faster than class components. With React Hooks, you can manage state and side effects more efficiently.
2. **Memoization**: Memoization techniques like `React.memo` and the `useMemo` hook can prevent unnecessary re-renders by caching the results of expensive computations.
3. **Virtualization**: Implement virtualization techniques, such as using the `react-window` or `react-virtualized` libraries, to render only the visible elements in long lists or tables, reducing the DOM size and rendering time.
4. **Optimize Rendering**: Ensure that you are rendering only the necessary components when state or props change. Use shouldComponentUpdate for class components or PureComponent, React.memo, and the useCallback hook for functional components to control when they re-render.
5. **Code Splitting**: Split your application into smaller, manageable chunks using features like React's built-in `lazy` and `Suspense` or tools like Webpack's dynamic imports. This reduces the initial load time and improves perceived performance.
6. **Tree Shaking**: Use a build tool like Webpack to eliminate dead code (tree shaking) and bundle only the code that is actually used in your application.
7. **Component Splitting**: Split your application into smaller components that focus on doing one thing well. This not only improves maintainability but can also help reduce the amount of work React needs to do when a change occurs.
8. **Use PureComponent**: In class components, use `PureComponent` to automatically shallow compare props and state to determine if a re-render is necessary. For functional components, use the `React.memo` higher-order component.
9. **Minimize Prop Drilling**: Avoid excessive passing of props through multiple components. Use context or state management libraries like Redux or MobX to manage shared state.
10. **Reduce Re-renders**: Limit the use of `forceUpdate`, as it bypasses the typical component lifecycle and can lead to unnecessary re-renders.
11. **Avoid Inline Functions**: Minimize the creation of inline anonymous functions in the render method, as they can cause re-renders
12. **Code Profiling**: Use tools like React's built-in Profiler, browser dev tools, or third-party tools like React DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks in your application and optimize accordingly.
13. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement server-side rendering to pre-render content on the server, which can improve the initial load time and SEO.
14. **Optimize Images and Assets**: Compress and serve images and assets efficiently. Use responsive images and consider using lazy loading for images that are not immediately visible.
15. **Caching and Network Optimization**: Implement client-side caching strategies, leverage browser caching, and optimize network requests to reduce latency.
