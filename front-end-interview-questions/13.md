# What is Event Delegation?

Event Delegation is a common approach to avoid too many event listeners, which is used in jQuery and React.

Could you explain how Event Delegation work?

## Answer

> Event delegation allows you to handle events on multiple elements with a single event listener.

This approach is useful when you have a large number of elements that need event handling, as it helps reduce the number of event listeners in your code, which can improve performance and simplify your code.

### How it's done ?

The basic idea behind event delegation is to attach a single event listener to a common ancestor element that contains all the target elements you want to monitor. When an event occurs on one of the target elements, the event bubbles up to the common ancestor, where the single event listener can then identify the target element and execute the desired action.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Event Delegation Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul id="taskList">
      <li>Task 1</li>
      <li>Task 2</li>
      <li>Task 3</li>
      <li>Task 4</li>
      <li>Task 5</li>
    </ul>

    <script>
      // Get a reference to the common ancestor element
      const taskList = document.getElementById("taskList");

      // Add a single event listener to the common ancestor
      taskList.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
        // Check if the clicked element is an <li> element
        if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
          // Handle the click event for <li> elements
          console.log(`Clicked on: ${event.target.textContent}`);
          // Perform some action, e.g., mark the task as completed
          event.target.classList.toggle("completed");
        }
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have an unordered list (`<ul>`) with several list items (`<li>` elements). Instead of attaching a separate click event listener to each `<li>` element, we attach a single event listener to the `<ul>` element, which is the common ancestor of all the `<li>` elements.

When a user clicks on any list item, the click event bubbles up to the `<ul>` element, and the event listener checks if the clicked target is an `<li>` element. If it is, it performs the desired action, which is toggling the "completed" class in this case.

### Why ?

Using event delegation in this way can make your code more efficient and maintainable, especially when dealing with a large number of dynamically generated elements. It reduces the overhead of managing individual event listeners for each element and simplifies event handling logic.
