# How to detect crash of a web page?

A very interesting question. onbeforeunload could be used to let us know right before a page is unloaded.

But if the web page crashes, the JavaScript doesn't even have chance to run.

So how could we know that a web page crashed because of unexpected reasons?

## Answer

JavaScript events like `onbeforeunload` won't be triggered in situations of unexpected errors. However, there are several approaches you can take to monitor and detect web page crashes:

**Monitoring Services**:
Use external monitoring services like Pingdom, UptimeRobot, or StatusCake that periodically ping your website and notify you if it becomes unreachable.

**Server-Side Monitoring**: Have your web server log errors and crashes. You can set up tools like New Relic, Sentry, or Rollbar to track JavaScript errors on the server and receive timely notifications.

**Client-Side Error Tracking**: Tracking tools like Sentry or LogRocket can capture JavaScript errors and unexpected behavior in the browser and send reports to a server.

**Heartbeat Mechanism**: A client-side "heartbeat" mechanism periodically sends a signal to your server to indicate that the page is still alive. If the server stops receiving these signals, it can assume that the page has crashed.

**Browser Extensions**: Some browser extensions and plugins, such as "Page Monitor" can be configured to monitor web pages and notify you of changes.

**Window onerror Event**: This event captures unhandled JavaScript errors. While this won't detect a full page crash, it can help identify if there are critical JavaScript errors .

**User Reports**: Encourage users to report crashes, allowing users to report when they encounter problems or crashes.

**Session Monitoring**: Keep track of user sessions and their activities. If a user's session suddenly ends without proper termination, it might be an indicator of a crash.

**Network Monitoring**: Use network monitoring tools to track traffic to your website. A sudden drop in incoming requests could be a sign of a crash.
