## Answer

> [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) are three-digit numbers sent by a server to indicate the outcome of a client's request made to a web server. They provide information about whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action from the client.

These status codes are an essential part of the HTTP protocol, helping both clients and servers communicate effectively about the outcome of requests and any necessary actions to be taken.

### 1xx - Informational

These are provisional responses indicating that the server has received the request and is continuing to process it.

- `100 Continue`: The server has received the initial part of the request, and the client can proceed to send the request body, if applicable.

---

### 2xx - Success

These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed by the server.

- `200 OK`: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested resource.
- `201 Created`: The request has led to the creation of a new resource on the server.
- `204 No Content`: The request was successful, but there is no data to send back in the response body.

---

### 3xx - Redirection

These codes indicate that further action is required by the client to fulfill the request. The client may need to follow a redirect.

- `301 Moved Permanently`: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URL.
- `302 Found (or 307 Temporary Redirect)`: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL.
- `304 Not Modified`: The client's cached copy of the resource is still valid, and there is no need to download it again.

---

### 4xx - Client Errors

These codes indicate that the client has made an error in the request.

- `400 Bad Request`: The server cannot understand or process the client's request due to malformed syntax or other issues.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required to access the resource.
- `403 Forbidden`: The server understood the request, but it refuses to fulfill it, often due to insufficient permissions.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource does not exist on the server.

---

### 5xx - Server Errors

These codes indicate that the server encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.

- `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message indicating that something went wrong on the server.
- `502 Bad Gateway`: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: The server is temporarily unavailable due to overload or maintenance.
