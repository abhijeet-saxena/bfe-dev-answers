# `Array.prototype.forEach()` vs `Array.prototype.map()`

An easy question, right?

It really depends on what you want to achieve.

In case you are not sure, read MDN about forEach() and map()

## Answer

[Array.prototype.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) and [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) are both methods available for arrays in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases.

### Array.prototype.forEach()

It is used for iterating over an array and performing a specified operation for each element in the array. It does not create a new array and is primarily used for side effects.

> Syntax: `array.forEach(callback(currentValue, index, array))`

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
numbers.forEach((num, index) => {
  console.log(`Element at index ${index}: ${num}`);
});

// Output:
// Element at index 0: 1
// Element at index 1: 2
// Element at index 2: 3
// Element at index 3: 4
```

In this example, `forEach` iterates over each element in the `numbers` array and logs each element along with its index.

### Array.prototype.map():

It is used for creating a new array by applying a specified transformation function to each element in the original array. It returns a new array without modifying the original array.

> Syntax: `const newArray = array.map(callback(currentValue, index, array))`

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

In this example, `map` creates a new array `doubled` by multiplying each element in the `numbers` array by 2, without modifying the original `numbers` array.

---

In summary, use `forEach` when you want to iterate over an array and perform some action or side effect for each element. Use `map` when you want to transform each element in an array into a new value and create a new array with those transformed values.
