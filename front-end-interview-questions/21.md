# What is DNS? How does it work?

This is a good-to-know question.

I found this article from CloudFlare super helpful.

## Answer

[DNS(Domain Name System)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DNS), is a fundamental technology used on the internet to translate human-friendly domain names into [IP (Internet Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IP_Address) addresses.

This system serves as a critical part of how the internet functions, allowing users to access websites and other online resources using easy-to-remember domain names, like www.example.com, instead of having to remember complex IP addresses, such as 192.168.1.1.

Here's how DNS works:

1. **User enters a domain name:** When you enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or click on a link in your web browser, your computer or device sends a request to a DNS resolver.
2. **DNS resolver query:** The DNS resolver, often provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a third-party DNS service receives your request. If it already has the corresponding IP address in its cache, it can quickly provide the IP address.
3. **Recursive query:** If the DNS resolver doesn't have the IP address in its cache or is unable to provide a response, it starts a recursive query to the root DNS servers.
4. **Root DNS servers:** The root DNS servers hold information about the top-level domain (TLD) servers responsible for specific domain extensions. The root servers respond to the resolver with information about the TLD server responsible for the requested domain's extension.
5. **TLD DNS servers:** The resolver then queries the TLD DNS server that responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for that domain.
6. **Authoritative DNS server:** The resolver contacts the authoritative DNS server for the requested domain and requests the IP address associated with the specific subdomain or hostname.
7. **IP address retrieval:** The authoritative DNS server provides the IP address of the requested domain back to the DNS resolver.
8. **Response to the user:** The DNS resolver caches the IP address for future use and returns the IP address to the user's device.
9. **Connection to web server:** With the IP address in hand, the user's device can now establish a connection to the web server hosting the website associated with the domain name.

This entire process happens very quickly and transparently to the user, allowing them to access websites and online resources using easy-to-remember domain names while the underlying DNS infrastructure ensures that their requests are routed to the correct servers on the internet.
