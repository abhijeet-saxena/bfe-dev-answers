# What happens when you type a URL in browser's address bar?

You can talk for a long time for this question.

I'd suggest you first list it up concisely and then dig into the details if time permits, or give the interviewer a chance to pick.

## Answer

When you type a [URL (Uniform Resource Locator)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) in a browser's address bar and press Enter, several steps occur to retrieve and display the web page:

1. **URL Parsing:** The browser parses the URL to identify the [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), [domain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Domain) (e.g., www.example.com), and optional path or [query parameters](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/).
2. **DNS Resolution:** The browser checks its local cache or sends a request to a [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DNS) server to translate the domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into an [IP address](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IP_Address), which is needed to locate the web server.
3. **TCP Connection:** The browser establishes a [TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP) connection with the web server at the obtained IP address, using the appropriate port (typically port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS).
4. **HTTP(S) Request:** The browser sends an [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP) or [HTTPS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS) request to the web server, specifying the method (e.g., GET), the path, and other headers. This request asks the server to retrieve the desired web page.
5. **Server Processing:** The web server processes the request, locates the requested resource (e.g., an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Html) file), and assembles a response.
6. **HTTP(S) Response:** The server sends an HTTP or HTTPS response back to the browser, including the requested web page's content and headers.
7. **Rendering:** The browser receives the response and starts rendering the web page. It processes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets, rendering the page's visual layout and interactivity.
8. **Display:** The final rendered web page is displayed in the browser window for the user to interact with.

Throughout this process, there may be additional steps, such as handling redirects, caching, and [SSL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSL)/[TLS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) encryption for secure connections (HTTPS).

These steps collectively enable users to access and view web content by entering a URL in the browser's address bar.
