# Explain `async` and `await`

You use async and await keyword every day, what is exactly these keyword doing?

Refer to the MDN document here if are not sure.

You definitely would shine yourself if you mention that the behavior is similar to combining generators and promises.

## Answer

[async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) and [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) are features in JavaScript that are used to work with asynchronous code and make it more readable and easier to manage.

### `async` Function:

An `async` function is a special type of function that always returns a promise. Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved.

### `await` Keyword:

The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to pause its execution until a promise is settled (either resolved or rejected). It allows you to work with asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable way, as if it were synchronous.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `await` keyword is used to wait for the `fetch` request to complete and the response to be resolved before moving on to the next line of code.

### Combining Generators and Promises:

There is a similarity between `async/await` and combining generators and promises in terms of managing asynchronous code. Generator functions can be paused and resumed using the `yield` keyword, which allowed for sequential asynchronous code execution.

While both approaches achieve similar goals of handling asynchronous code sequentially, there are some key differences:

1. **Readability**: `async/await` provides a more concise and readable way to handle asynchronous code, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

2. **Error Handling**: `async/await` allows for better error handling with `try/catch` blocks, while the generator approach requires more complex error handling mechanisms.

3. **Native Support**: `async/await` is a built-in feature of JavaScript, whereas combining generators and promises requires additional code and may not be as widely adopted.
