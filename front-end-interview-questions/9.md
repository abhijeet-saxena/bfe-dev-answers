# explain how different CSS `position` property works

if you can mention position: sticky and stacking context, definitely would shine out.

Nothing fancy, just need to remember all the position rules

## Answer

> The [position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) property in CSS is used to control the positioning of elements within a web page.

There are several values you can use for the `position` property, including `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`. Let's see how each of these values works â€“

- `position: static` is the default positioning for elements. Elements with `position: static;` are placed in the normal document flow and are not affected by the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left` properties.
- `position: relative` are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow. You can use the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to adjust their position.
- `position: absolute` are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a `position` value other than `static`). If there is no positioned ancestor, they are positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
- `position: fixed` are positioned relative to the viewport and do not move when the page is scrolled. They stay fixed in the same position on the screen.
- `position: sticky;` are initially positioned according to the normal flow, but they become "sticky" and remain in their position as long as they are within the viewport. Once they reach a certain scroll position, they "stick" to that position.

### Stacking Context:

> The [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context) is a concept in CSS that determines the order in which elements are rendered on top of each other. Each element creates its own stacking context, and the stacking order within a context is determined by the `z-index` property.

Example of creating a stacking context:

```css
.stacking-context {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}
```
