## Answer

Since there are 12 hours on a clock face, this means that for each hour, the hour hand moves 360° / 12 hours = 30° per hour.

Also, The minute hand of a clock moves 360° for every 60 minutes, which simplifies to 360° / 60 minutes = 6° per hour.

Thus, to find the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 3:15, you can use the following formula:

`Angle = |(30*H - (11/2)*M)|`

- H is the current hour (3 in this case).
- M is the current minute (15 in this case).

Let's calculate it:

Angle = |(30*3 - (11/2)*15)|

Angle = |(90 - 82.5)|

Angle = |7.5|

So, the angle between the hour and minute hands at 3:15 is **7.5°**
