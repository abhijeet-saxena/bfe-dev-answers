# What are the time and space complexity for sorting algorithms

FrontEnd engineer interviews are usually not about difficult algorithm problems. Yet still it is a must to comprehend the cost of common sorting algorithms.

First you should remember how many sorting algorithms are there, and how they work.

Then you should answer the average time/space complexity for each, and also the worst case for each.

Don't forget to mention the stability.

## Answer

Here are some common sorting algorithms, along with their average time/space complexity and worst-case scenarios, as well as stability information:

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Average Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Stability:** Stable

### Selection Sort

Selection sort divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region.

- **Average Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Stability:** Unstable

---

### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.

- **Average Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Stability:** Stable

---

### Merge Sort

Merge sort divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

- **Average Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Stability:** Stable

---

### Quick Sort

Quick sort picks a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, according to whether elements are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

- **Average Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Stability:** Unstable

---

### Heap Sort

Heap sort turns the array into a binary heap, then repeatedly removes the maximum element from the heap and adds it to the sorted part of the array.

- **Average Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Stability:** Unstable
