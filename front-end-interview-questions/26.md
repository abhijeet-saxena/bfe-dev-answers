## Answer

> [CDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a distributed network of servers strategically located in various data centers across the globe.

Here's why we use CDNs:

1. **Faster Content Delivery**: CDNs cache content on their servers, which are geographically dispersed. This results in faster loading times and improved website performance.
2. **Reduced Server Load**: CDNs offload a significant portion of the traffic from a website's origin server. This is especially beneficial during traffic spikes or DDoS attacks, as CDNs can absorb a large portion of the incoming requests.
3. **Improved Scalability**: CDNs are designed to scale easily to accommodate growing website traffic without having to invest in additional server infrastructure.
4. **Enhanced Reliability**: CDNs offer redundancy and failover capabilities. If one CDN server goes down, requests are automatically routed to the next closest server, ensuring continuous availability and reliability of content.
5. **Security**: CDNs often include security features like DDoS protection, Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and SSL/TLS encryption.
6. **Global Reach**: CDNs' global presence ensures that users from different parts of the world can access content quickly, regardless of their location.
7. **Bandwidth Savings**: CDNs can compress and optimize content, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred leading to cost savings for both website owners and users.
8. **Analytics and Reporting**: CDNs typically provide detailed analytics and reporting tools that allow website owners to monitor traffic, user behavior, and other relevant metrics.

CDNs are an essential part of modern web infrastructure, especially for websites with a global audience or high traffic volumes.
