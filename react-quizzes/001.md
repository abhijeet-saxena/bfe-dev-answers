# the React Counter app

As the first React problem, you are asked to create the famous Counter app.

1. counter starts from 0.
2. click the '+' button to increment.
3. click the '-' button to decrement.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

export function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const updateCount = (diff: number) => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + diff);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button data-testid="decrement-button" onClick={() => updateCount(-1)}>
        -
      </button>
      <button data-testid="increment-button" onClick={() => updateCount(1)}>
        +
      </button>
      <p>clicked: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
